# SWAMID Metadata Tool

This is a tool for handling XML for a fedration.
Built for having a copy of production XML and importing each file when they are changed. In SWAMID we have all files in a GIT repositary and all exaples is based on this.
The users can then add/update the XML and request publication. Operations team will then verify and import into GIT-repositary / or automaticaly add based on installation.
